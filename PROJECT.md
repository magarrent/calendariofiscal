# Calendario Fiscal - Project Knowledge Base

## Business Overview

**Calendario Fiscal** is a SaaS platform that helps Spanish businesses and self-employed professionals never miss a tax deadline. The platform centralizes all Spanish tax obligations (Modelos from AEAT) into one calendar, sends intelligent reminders, and integrates with external calendar applications.

### The Problem We Solve

Spanish businesses face complex tax obligations with multiple deadlines throughout the year. Missing a deadline results in penalties, interest charges, and potential legal issues. Small businesses and self-employed individuals often:
- Struggle to track multiple tax models (Modelo 130, 303, 347, etc.)
- Miss deadlines due to poor organization
- Waste time manually checking AEAT for upcoming obligations
- Pay penalties that could have been avoided
- Use spreadsheets or paper calendars that don't send reminders

### Our Solution

A centralized tax calendar platform that:
- **Automatically knows** which tax obligations apply to your business type
- **Sends timely reminders** (1, 7, 15, or 30 days before deadlines)
- **Integrates with your existing calendar** (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook)
- **Tracks completion** so you never file the same form twice
- **Provides direct links** to AEAT for easy filing

- **Testing**: Pest 4 (feature + browser tests)
- **Database**: SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL/MySQL (production)
- **Email**: Laravel Mail (SMTP/SES/Mailgun)
- **Notifications**: Queued (database/Redis)

### Key Technical Patterns
- **Livewire Reactive UI**: Full-stack framework, no separate frontend
- **Session-Based Filters**: User filter preferences persist across sessions
- **Query Scopes**: Complex filtering in Eloquent models
- **Queued Notifications**: Async email sending to avoid blocking
- **Token-Based Public API**: Calendar subscription uses secure tokens
- **Audit Trail**: NotificationLog prevents duplicate sends

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Database refresh
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Run tests
php artisan test --compact

# Send reminders (scheduled daily)
php artisan app:send-tax-model-reminders

# Format code
vendor/bin/pint --dirty
```

## Quick Reference for Future Development

**When adding a new feature, consider**:
1. **User Value**: Does this help users avoid penalties or save time?
2. **Business Model**: Is this a free or premium feature?
3. **Complexity**: Can we build it without overcomplicating the UI?
4. **Data Privacy**: Does this respect user privacy and GDPR?
5. **Scalability**: Will this work for 10,000 users?

**User-first principles**:
- Simplicity over features
- Clear over clever
- Proactive over reactive
- Trustworthy over fancy

**Business-first principles**:
- Solve a painful problem (missed deadlines cost money)
